#### Install homebrew (skip if you already did)
```bash
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

#### Update and Install Go

```bash
brew update && brew install golang
```
#### Setup Workspace
It’s considered good practice to use $HOME/go location for your workspace, so let’s do that!
```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/go/{bin,src,pkg}
```
We created two important folders bin and src that’ll be used for GO

#### Setup Environment
We’ll need to add to .bashrc or .zshrc (if you’re using zsh) with the following info. (Ex: nano ~/.bashrc)
```bash
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export GOROOT="$(brew --prefix golang)/libexec"
export PATH="$PATH:${GOPATH}/bin:${GOROOT}/bin"
```
reload the settings with 
```bash
source $HOME/.bashrc (or .zshrc )
```
Feel free to start any project (make new folder) under ~/go/src and go from there.

### Bonus Point : Install Go Version Manager (GVM)
if you would like to run several versions of GO
```bash
bash < <(curl -s -S -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moovweb/gvm/master/binscripts/gvm-installer)
```
#### List all GO versions
```bash
gvm listall
```
#### Install specific version of GO
```bash
gvm install go1.16.2
```
#### Select default version of GO to use
```bash
gvm use go1.16.2 [--default]
```
